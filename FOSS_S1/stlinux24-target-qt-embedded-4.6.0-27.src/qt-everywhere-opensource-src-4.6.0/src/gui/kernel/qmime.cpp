    \brief The QMimeSource class is an abstraction of objects that
           provided formatted data of a certain MIME type.

    \obsolete

    The preferred approach to drag and drop is to use QDrag in
    conjunction with QMimeData. See \l{Drag and Drop} for details.

    \sa QMimeData, QDrag

    \fn const char *QMimeSource::format(int i) const

    Returns the (\a i - 1)-th supported MIME format, or 0.
*/

    \fn QByteArray QMimeSource::encodedData(const char *format) const

    Returns the encoded data of this object in the specified MIME
    \a format.
*/

/*!
    Returns true if the object can provide the data in format \a
    mimeType; otherwise returns false.

    If you inherit from QMimeSource, for consistency reasons it is
    better to implement the more abstract canDecode() functions such
    as QTextDrag::canDecode() and QImageDrag::canDecode().
